# pyFLIR

## About
This goal for this project is to create a Python library for interacting with FLIR cameras.  Specifially the
FLIR Tau 2 336.  In my opinion the FLIR Camera Controller GUI leaves a lot of functionality to be desired, so 
I decided it would be more fun to make my own interface, and then build applications around it.
